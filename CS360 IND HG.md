## Project 1 - Individual Section
### 1. New e-Commerce site
> The e-commerce site should use the Incremental model. This is because it allows early 
delivery of important features to users who can give feedback and it allows new optional 
features for the website to be added later on.
### 2. Dental office site
> The dental office site should use the RUP model. This is because the website can use an 
agile model to develop basic features first like showing users clinic hours, location, 
dental staff, and downloadable forms, but can then use a linear model later on to add 
appointment booking, automated text reminders, and issue discounts.
### 3. Nuclear Power Plant
> The nuclear power plant should use the Spiral model. This is because it focuses on risk 
analysis and allows for iterative changes for safety, along with thorough validation at 
each step.
### 4. Department of Transportation
> The department of transportation should use the Waterfall model. This is because the 
requirements are clearly defined in the 100 page specification and because a clear deadline 
is set requiring planning.
### 5. Reducing Traffic
> Reducing traffic should use the Spiral model. This is because it focuses on risk analysis 
which is required for software interacting with hardware, iterative changes for safety, 
along with prototyping.
### 6. Educational game
> The educational game should use the Incremental model. This is because the main game can be 
developed quickly, and more features can be added to the game over time.
### 7. Global Health
> Global health should use the Incremental model. This is because it can allow fast delivery 
of an early version to show progress and get more grants, also allowing early feedback for 
new features and changes that need to be made.
