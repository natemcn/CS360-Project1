## Project 1 - Group Section

### 1. New e-Commerce site
> Our group’s choice is the **Scrum model** as the flexibility of **Scrum** allows for ease of rearrangement for requirements and responsibilities along with scheduled workflow required for a system with multiple teams involved.

> The group also considered **Incremental model** however, **Scrum** was chosen for the following reasons:
> * The project requires collaboration between two teams therefore it is important to have a steady stream of communication and tasks done on time.
> * A sprint produces a deliverable which can be iterated upon further and is beneficial for feedback
> * The team consists of developers with a wide range of experience and the frequent communication of the **Scrum model** allows for keeping tabs on development and adjusting accordingly. 

### 2. Dental office site
> As a group we decided on the **Rational Unified Process (RUP)** because we believe the website should use an agile model first to develop basic features like showing users clinic hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms to get the website up and running quickly. Then the website can use a linear model to later add features like appointment booking, automated text reminders, and issue discounts because these features are more complex and require planning and testing due to things like integration with external systems, security, and reliable interactions with users.

> Another option we considered was the **Incremental model** but we chose **RUP model** over this for the following reasons:
> * **RUP** supports both agile models like incremental and linear models
> * **Incremental** is mostly used for delivering chunks of software at a time not building a full system at once before adding new features
> * **Incremental** does not require detailed planning from the start
> * **RUP** is better for projects that start simple but grow with complexity

> The key aspect of the project that influenced our decision were:
> * Early delivery of basic features and the ability to add new features later on
> * The complexity of future features needing more time for development

### 3. Nuclear Power Plant
> As a group we decided on the **Waterfall model** because this project requires reliability and heavy documentation. Because of how dangerous a Nuclear Power Plant can be, each step of development should be fully completed and validated before moving on to the next step. The Waterfall Model also allows for all requirements to be fully understood before development starts and for testing and validation to be fully performed before the software is deployed.

> Another model we considered was the **Spiral model** because of its focus on risk analysis and iterative development. The **Spiral model** would also allow for continuous change that could increase the risk of bugs to appear which is something we would want to avoid in a safety critical system. We also considered the **V-model** but decided a linear structured model would fit better with this project for avoiding an increase in complexity that could cause issues we would want to avoid in a safety critical system.

> The key aspects of the project that influenced our decision were:
> * Safety and reliability requirements
> * Long term maintainability

### 4. Department of Transportation
> The **Waterfall model** is a strong fit because of the clearly defined, and detailed 100-page specification provided by the Department of Transportation. This documentation helps the team follow a structured, linear development with no need for iterative changes. Since the project involves developing and deploying a cloud-based app within 18-months, **Waterfall’s** ability to structure in phases supports scheduling and planned deadlines. The company can linearly move through development and refer to the specification as the strict plan.  

> We considered both the **Agile** and **Reuse models**. **Agile** was ruled out because it is useful in environments with flexible requirements that change over time with rapid feedback. This isn’t the case with this project since we have our specification detailed ahead of time. **Reuse** was also considered, but ultimately rejected because while the team does have experience in transportation systems, this project has strict specification which limits the flexibility in reusing existing components without greater modification. 

> The most important aspect to our decision was the existence of a complete and detailed specification document because this allows us to use **Waterfall** to create an early plan and design the system around the known requirements.

### 5. Reducing Traffic
> The **Spiral model** is the most suitable SDLC for this project because it allows our team to focus on tackling the riskiest elements first before moving on, all while delivering multiple functional prototypes. This project requires us to work within the constraints of an embedded system and manage the risks that come with that. This model gives us dedicated steps focused on risk analysis in between deliverables which will help us advance our prototype.  
> Our group also considered the **Waterfall model** and the **V-Model**, both strong options that allow the team to mitigate risk through extensive testing and analysis. The simple fact that the Spiral model allows our team to perform testing and analysis while producing prototypes is why our team chose to move forward with it. 

> The key aspect of the project that informed our decision was the requirement to incorporate our distributed computing into existing hardware. Our team has a substantial amount of experience working with embedded systems and feel confident in our approach, which will allow us to deliver our prototypes to the head company.

### 6. Educational game
> We selected the **Kanban model** for this project due to its flexibility, speed, and emphasis on continuous delivery. These are essential qualities because we need to meet the needs of both internal and external customers who expect frequent, functional releases of the game. Since the requirements of the game are preliminary and evolving, it was essential to use an SDLC that supports iterative development and regular feedback. **Kanban**, in particular, helps to visualize the work and adapt priorities in real-time based on customer feedback. Additionally, having a small team size makes this well suited for **Kanban**/Agile because it allows for efficient collaboration and quick deployment of software. 

> We considered using **Waterfall** and **Incremental models**. **Waterfall** was rejected because it requires a fixed set of requirements and doesn’t support projects that have many changes, which would slow down delivery and responsiveness to user feedback. Since this project has evolving requirements, Waterfall was ruled out. The **Incremental model** seemed to fit better, but it lacked the focus on the collaboration of the small team and the flexibility offered by Kanban. 

> The 2 most important factors that led to our decision was the evolving requirements of the game and the urgency to release a playable version of the game. Both of these factors meant that the plan and design of the system needed to be extremely flexible to change mid-project and the ability to deliver usable builds of the game quickly for both the internal and external customer to test.

### 7. Global Health
> The **Scrum model** is our team’s choice for this project, given our small team size and the need for rapid growth. **Scrum** is a flexible methodology that allows us to move quickly and demonstrate progress which will be key to securing additional funding.  
> We chose **Scrum** over the **Iterative model**. While **Iterative** development is well-suited for delivering incremental improvements over time, it lacks the fast-paced structure that Scrum offers. Our priority is to deliver quickly and adapt based on our feedback, which **Scrum** supports through brief sprints.  

> The two key aspects that influenced our decision were:  
> * Our small team of five members.  
> * The need to secure future grants by showing real world impact quickly.  

>These factors make Scrum the clear choice, it will help us develop our product as efficiently and responsively as possible while donor interest is high.
