## 1: New e-Commerce site
> `First Answer`

## 2: Dental office site
> `Second Answer`

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant
> Given project three's critial system status, it is only right that its model be the Waterfall model. While I have in my teams performance regardless of the methodology, ensuring this project is completely reliable and safe is my top priority. 

## 4: Department of Transportation
> Project 4 requires the Waterfall Model seeing as the plans have been layed out in extreme detail. The 100 pages of specifications, coupled with the fact that this is a governemnt application, means they expect a full fledged product on the due date. 

## 5: Reducing Traffic
> A GPS product is something that benefits from having multiple prototypes and tackling the riskiest components early while the hardware is not finalized. For this reason I have the spiral model over the waterfall model. While it might seem as though the waterfall model applies here, the spiral model benefits from being able to make modifications and have multiple functional prototypes. 

## 6: Educational game
> The gaming community demands constant faced paced updates which is why an agile method is best used here. Specifically Kanban as it will simply the process of fixing problems and visually represent our progress to help us stay on track. 

## 7: Global Health
> For our small team and large budget, an Agile approach would be best, in this case we will utilize Scrum. With the possibilty to earn more funding in the near future we must be able to both, show our impact and scale up as needed. The flexibilty scrum gives us will help our progress and growth.
