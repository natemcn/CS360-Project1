# CS360 Project 1 Nate M

## 1: New e-Commerce site
> Maintaining a website is a constantly evolving and demanding task, for that reason we should use the Kanban model. Planning for a task such as this one is much easier when accompanied by a visual element. One that allows us to see our priorities and progress in the same place. 

## 2: Dental office site
> Incremental development is the best approach for this dental office site. They have a long time frame and expect continous updates to roll out new features so we will use this to our advantage and use a method that benefits from that criteria. 

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant
> Given project three's critial system status, it is only right that its model be the Waterfall model. While I have in my teams performance regardless of the methodology, ensuring this project is completely reliable and safe is my top priority. 

## 4: Department of Transportation
> Project 4 requires the Waterfall Model seeing as the plans have been layed out in extreme detail. The 100 pages of specifications, coupled with the fact that this is a governemnt application, means they expect a full fledged product on the due date. 

## 5: Reducing Traffic
> A GPS product is something that benefits from having multiple prototypes and tackling the riskiest components early while the hardware is not finalized. For this reason I have the spiral model over the waterfall model. While it might seem as though the waterfall model applies here, the spiral model benefits from being able to make modifications and have multiple functional prototypes. 

## 6: Educational game
> The gaming community demands constant faced paced updates which is why an agile method is best used here. Specifically Kanban as it will simply the process of fixing problems and visually represent our progress to help us stay on track. 

## 7: Global Health
> For our small team and large budget, an Agile approach would be best, in this case we will utilize Scrum. With the possibilty to earn more funding in the near future we must be able to both, show our impact and scale up as needed. The flexibilty scrum gives us will help our progress and growth.
