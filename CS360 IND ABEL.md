## 1: New E-Commerce Site
### Model: Reuse
> The **reuse model** is the best for this e-commerce site because the company already has in-house templates and custom scriptingfor generating web pages. This model would reuse these existing tools with minimal changes. This is helpful because most ofthe system is already built, and there would be a massive reduction in coding effort which would speed up the delivery of the site.

## 2: Dental Office Site
### Model: Incremental
> The **incremental model** was chosen because the customer wants to "continually add updates", and the incrmental model is perfect for step-by-step approach rather than waiting for all the feautures to be ready. Since the dentist wants to add more feautures over time, a flexbile approach is needed. Additionally with incremental, we can deliver a basis webiste fast so we can give the customer something to test and give feedback on.

## 3: Nuclear Power Plant
### Model: Waterfall
> The **waterfall model** fits the most for this project because we value safety, reliablity, and a complaiance with standards for the power plant. The waterfall model is good for upfront planning which reduces the risk in the later stages which helps the power plan maintin reliablity. Since this is a nuclear power plant, there are string regulations and contrainst. The waterfall model can factor this in by creating strict structure and planning that happense before any impmentation takes place which allow the system to meet the strict specficications of the power plant.

## 4: Department of Transportation:
### Model: Reuse
> The **reuse model** is perfect since the "company has developed a similar solution in the transportation domain". Since the company has previous experience with similar transportation-related applications, the reuse model allows them to reuse existing software components from their other projects, reducing development time and costs.

## 5: Reducing Trafiic

## 6: Educational Game
### Model: Agile
> The **agile model** is best for the educational game because the production needs to be fast, flexibile, and continous feedback. Development of the game is based on a preliminary and evolving set of requirements, showing that this project has a flexible set of requirements which Agile is good for. Customers of this product expect frequent delivery and testing, which means the team must deliver working software in cycles. Becuase we are directly involed with users through conferences and marketing, we need quickly incorporate user feedback into the development process.

## 7: Global Health
### Model: Incremental
> The **incremental model** is the best because it allows the development team to deliver working software in small pieces, which reduces risk. Instead of waiting until the very end to deliver a full product, each increment introduces more components that can be tested and improved. This is important for this specific project because the company is relying on grant funding and has the poential to recieve more based on demonstrated impact. The incrementalmodel allows us to deliver tangible software that can show the progress to stakeholders/customers.
