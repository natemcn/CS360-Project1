## Project 1 - Individual Section
### 1. New e-Commerce site
The e-commorce site should use the Incremental model because it allows early delivery 
of important features to users who can give feedback and it allows new optional 
features for the website to be added later on.
### 2. Dental office site
The dental office site should use the RUP model because the website can use an agile 
model to develop basic features first like showing users clinic hours, location, 
dental staff, and downloadable forms, but can then use a linear model later on to add 
appointment booking, automated text reminders, and issue discounts.
### 3. Nuclear Power Plant
The nucelear power plant should use the Spiral model because it focuses on risk analysis 
and allows for iterative changes for safety, along with thorough validation at each step.
### 4. Department of Transportation
The department of transportation should use the Waterfall model because the requirements 
are clearly defined in the 100 page specification and because a clear deadline is set 
requiring planning.
### 5. Reducing Traffic
Reducing traffic should use the Spiral model because it focuses on risk analysis which 
is required for software interacting with hardware, iterative changes for safety, along 
with prototyping.
### 6. Educational game
The educational game should use the Incremental model because the main game can be 
developed quickly, and more features can be added to the game overtime.
### 7. Global Health
Globale health should use the Incremental model to deliver an early version to show 
progress and get more grants, also allowing early feedback for new features and changes 
that need to be made.


TEST

> As a group we decided on the **Rational Unified Process (RUP)** because we believe the website should use an agile method first to develop basic features like showing users clinic hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms to get the website up and running quickly. Then the website can use a linear method to later add features like appointment booking, automated text reminders, and issue discounts because these features are more complex and require planning and testing due to things like integration with external systems, security, and reliable interactions with users.

> Another option we considered was the Incremental Method but we chose RUP over this for the following reasons:
> * RUP supports both agile methods like incremental and a linear method
> * Incremental is mostly used for delivering chunks of software at a time not building a full system at once before adding new features
> * Incremental does not require detailed planning from the start
> * RUP is better for projects that start simple but grow with complexity
