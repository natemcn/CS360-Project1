## Project 1 - Individual Section
### 1. New e-Commerce site
The e-commorce site should use the incremental model because it allows early delivery 
of important features to users who can give feedback and it allows new optional 
features for the website to be added later on.
### 2. Dental office site
The dental office site should use the RUP model because the website can use an agile 
method to develop basic features first like showing users clinic hours, location, 
dental staff, and downloadable forms, but can then use a linear method later on to add 
appointment booking, automated text reminders, and issue discounts.
### 3. Nuclear Power Plant
Use Spiral method because it focuses on risk analysis and allows for 
iterative changes for safety, along with through validation at each step.
### 4. Department of Transportation
Use waterfall method because the requirements are clearly defined in the 
100 page specification and because a clear deadline is set requiring planning.
### 5. Reducing Traffic
Use Spiral method because it focuses on risk analysis which is required for software 
interacting with hardware, iterative changes for safety, along with prototyping.
### 6. Educational game
Use incremental method because the main game can be developed quickly, and more 
features can be added to the game overtime.
### 7. Global Health
Use incremental method to deliver early version to show progress and get more 
grants, also allowing early feedback for new features and changes that need to be made.


TEST

> As a group we decided on the **Rational Unified Process (RUP)** because we believe the website should use an agile method first to develop basic features like showing users clinic hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms to get the website up and running quickly. Then the website can use a linear method to later add features like appointment booking, automated text reminders, and issue discounts because these features are more complex and require planning and testing due to things like integration with external systems, security, and reliable interactions with users.

> Another option we considered was the Incremental Method but we chose RUP over this for the following reasons:
> * RUP supports both agile methods like incremental and a linear method
> * Incremental is mostly used for delivering chunks of software at a time not building a full system at once before adding new features
> * Incremental does not require detailed planning from the start
> * RUP is better for projects that start simple but grow with complexity
